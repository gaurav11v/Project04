ORS :) ORS is online web application that manage student and
       marksheet records .

***********************

Which Architecture is followed by ORS ?

MVC :)  MVC is framework methodology . It  separates code    
        implementation of an application into three component 
        Model , View , Controller .

************************

 Model :- Model contain business logic , data access logic ,
          integration logic to perform business operation and
          manipulate database .

 View :- View component is responsible to render the graphic 
         user interface .

 Controller :- Controller contain navigation logic and are
               responsible to perform business operation submitted
               by view with the help of model .

 **********************

                        Types of LOGICsss :)

Presentation logic :- This is the set of control statement that
                      decide look of user interface .(JSP)

Control logic :- This is the set of control statement that 
                 decide Navigation of user interface.

Business logic:- This is set of control statement that perform
                 business operation.(Change password , Forget Password)

Data Acess logic :- This is set of control statement that make 
                    changes in database with the help of JDBC.(JDBC,SQL)

Integration logic :- This is set of control statement that 
                     integrate application with another application
                     or server .(EMAIL SEND)

************************************

Design pattern :) 

           Standard problem has standard solution .

Singletone design pattern :- The class that has one instance in
                       their lifetime is called singletone
                     design pattern .

Builder design pattern :- Create complex object using simple object 
                           using step by step approach .

Factory design pattern :- The class that has ability to create
                         object of another class is called factory 
                         class that follow factory design pattern.

Front controller design pattern :- Main controller perform session
                                checking and loging operation 
                                before calling any application .
                               Prevent any user to access an application
                               without login . 

*************************************

Which class we make singletone class ? And how to make ?

 JDBC datasource class 

There are four steps to make single tone class :

1. Make a class  Final so that child can not be created for single
   class.

2. Make a default Constructor Private so that no one other class
   can instantiate single class .

3. Decleare a Static Variable of self type in single class
   static variable have only one copy in their lifetime .

4. Make a get Instance() Static method in singletone class
   that will return instance of same single class .

***********************

Acid Properties :- 

  Automicity means all or nothing .
  Consistancy means it make sure that data is in consistant state .
  Isolation means Transaction are independent .
  Duribility means commited data never lost .

***********************

WebServer name :- 

1. Apache Tomcat
2. Resine 
3. Klone
4. Oracle web tier
5. jigsaw

Application Server name :- 

1. Jboss
2. Websphere
3. WebLogic
4. Jetty
5. GlassFish


**********************
DCP :-
       It provide connection reusability & limit of maximum connection .

       Add c3p0(0.9.5) dependencie 
       JDBC Datasource class ko singletone bnai ComboPoolDataSource 
       ka object banaya ( cpds ) 
       cpds = null kiya 
       cpds me sare parameter ko set kiya 
       And connection provide kiya (  return getInstance().cpds.getConnection(); )

System.properties pr parameter liye hai :-

 url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/project4
 driver = com.mysql.cj.JDBC.Driver
 username = root
 password = root
 Database = JDBC
 Service = javaBean 
 acquireIncrement = 10
 initialpoolsize = 10
 maxpoolsize = 100
 minpoolsize = 10 
 timeout = 10

Ans : Alt + Shift + j 
      Project menu Generate Javadoc 
      Config me javadoc.exe path
      Select Destination 
      Visibility Private (we can access private attribute of class)
    
How to mapping of JavaDoc ?
 
Ans: /doc/index.html 

* Why we did mapping ?

It provide LooseCoupling ( By which we access any ctl or view easily)

What is filter ?

Ans : Filter perform Pre-Processing and Post-Processing operation
      on request and response of Client .

What is Session ?

Ans : Session is conversation b/w Browser web client & web server .
        Session is implicit object .

*What is Transition Handling ?

Ans : Transition is an atomic unit to be commited or rollback in a 
      single attempt . 

*1. conn.setAutocommit(false);
// True kyu nhi dete === kyuki vo null value ko save kr leta hai 
database me automatically data ko save nhi krnva na chahte hai pahle vo jake check kare
OR ==== kyu ki jb bhi koi exception aaye to vo data base me ek bhi record save na kre 

*2. conn.commit();
 forcefully data ko save  krta hai .

*3. conn.rollback();
unwanted data ko rollback me aajayega .
 
 DML - it is used to perform CRUD operation.(Add ,Update,delete)
 DDL :- it is used to perform create table, alter table, drop table.
 DCL :- it is used to rollback and commit.

JAVA = Just Another Virtual Asclator
JSP = Java Server Page 
API = Apllication Programming Interface
DDL = Data Defination Language(Perform create table , alter table ,drop table )
DML = Data Manupulation laguage(Perform Crud operation )
DCL = Data Control Language(used to rollback and commit)

PreparedStatement :-
               ( The PreparedStatement interface extends the Statement interface )
               
Difference b/w PreparedStatement  & Statement ?

PreparedStatement__ sends query to database at the time of instantiation and holds
compiled query . Whereas__ 
Statement__ does not holds compiled query so queries executed by statement are 
compiled and executed on every database call .
 
Difference b/w DoGet & DoPost ?

DoGet :- 
          Perform view logic .
          It does not carry data 
          Form submitted data is encoded in URL & appended a query string . 
          Parameter are save in browser history because they are part of URL .
          Contain only character .
          Can be cached .
          can be book marked .

DoPost:-
  
          Perform Submit logic .
          It carry data .
          Form submitted data is not a part of URL it is sent as message body of Http request .
          Paramter are not saved in browser history . 
          May contain binary data .
          cannot be cached .
          cannot be book marked .

Comparable : It has default nature of sorting order & it has compareTo() .
Compartor : It is customized & it has compare() .

Debugging : It is a process by which developer check the flow programm


Unchecked Exception : are optional to handle RuntimeException and Error classes
                      are unchecked exception . 

Chacked Exception : are Madatory to handle Keyword throw is mandatory to propagate
                    checked exception .
